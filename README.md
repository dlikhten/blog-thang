# A website thing

This is a website that will work entirely in React.js without the need for a back-end (yet).

Just serve the bundle.js and index.html from s3 static side and probably CloudFront and you have yourself a website.

This isn't anything special like a full-blown website generator, instead it will make some pretty specific structures
and just require some json to back it.

# Why?

If you want to re-use the skeleton and just provide your own data, feel free!

If you want to just read the code to get some bad ideas on how to make a static react site, enjoy!

# Bugs

Don't post any issues, I will immediately delete them as this isn't intended to be used as a library.
